# Albert Launcher Zed Projects Plugin

Quickly find and open your Zed workspaces right from your favourite launcher.

### Install

To install, copy or symlink this directory to `~/.local/share/albert/python/plugins/albert_zed_workspaces/`

Or just run `git clone https://github.com/HarshNarayanJha/albert_zed_workspaces ~/.local/share/albert/python/plugins/albert_zed_workspaces/`

### Development Setup

I use the Zed Editor (naturally). Python Developement includes `pyright` as `lsp` and `ruff` as `linter`.

Copy the `albert.pyi` file from `~/.local/share/albert/python/plugins/albert.pyi` to this directory for type definitions and completions!
